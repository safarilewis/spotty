# React Native App

## To need to have react native and expo installed on your laptop
### If you don't have expo, after installing node v16.18.1 run: 'npm install -g expo-cli'

## Installing dependencies

### 'npm install' should install all required dependencies, but if that fails follow the steps below

- Firebase 'npm install firebase'
- React Navigation: 'npm install @react-navigation/native'
- Extra react navigation dependencies: 'npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context'
- Bottom Tabs: 'npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs'
